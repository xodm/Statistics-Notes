# Chapter Reflection

The chapter was quite easy, not much seemed to be learned. The R part for me was exciting since I naively enjoy it. I didnt end up doing most of the questions, it is 6am, all my inexperiences caused me to take up 2 hours for the chapter, most was spent on how to work git and setting up R, so I am sufficed. I might go back to the questions! (Most likely wont). I hope i can do all the chapters. 11/28/24
